# SOME TEST CASES
On POST, add all required fields and it will return the new document.

On POST, leaving the required fields missing will return an error message and what kind of error (ex. "A name is required!")

Remember that req.body comes from Postman's Body tab and the key value pairs

On GET with an /:id, you must provide the specific ObjectId generated by MongoDB because it's a special hexadecimal, I suggest doing a GET with /api/products to get all products that I have injected and copying the _id from one of them. Switch out one of the numbers to test for the error. If you provide something like 123 on :id, then you'll catch my 500 status error and it'll explain that it's an object casting error

On DELETE, same as above on GET with an /:id, use the _id provided by MongoDB. On successful deletion, there's a message returned that says "Product deleted successfully" and on error, just says Product does not exist.

On PUT, /:id is still that special _id format. Add whatever you like on the Body, though I added a special option to enforce validation (update name to just "")

On GET as in api/products/, it will return all products in the DB. Use queries such as ?category=electronics, ?minPrice=2.99, ?inStock=false, ?sortBy=name:desc and a combination of any of them (?category=furniture&minPrice=10&sortBy=price:asc&inStock=false)
Though you might need to provide more products that match the specific filters
